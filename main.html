	<h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure that estimates the computational time an algorithm takes to execute based on the size of the input data. It helps evaluate the efficient performance of an algorithm and provides an upper bound on its efficiency.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input data. It helps assess how efficiently an algorithm uses memory resources during its execution. Just as time complexity evaluates the running time, space complexity evaluates memory consumption. For example, if an algorithm uses memory proportional to the input size, its space complexity can be expressed as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. This means that as the input size grows, the memory usage grows linearly. Understanding space complexity is crucial, especially in environments with limited memory or when working with large datasets.</p>
